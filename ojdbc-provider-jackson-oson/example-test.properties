# This file provides examples of properties that configure tests in this
# module.
#
# QUICK GUIDE TO RUNNING TESTS:
#   1. Create a copy of this file named "test.properties":
#      cp example-test.properties test.properties
#   2. In test.properties, replace example values with real values (the file is
#      .gitignore'd, so sensitive info won't be checked in to the repo)
#   3. Comment out any lines for which a value can not be provided (tests are
#      skipped if no value is configured).
#   4. mvn clean verify
#
# CONFIGURING TEST PROPERTIES
#   Test properties are read from a properties file by the TestProperties class.
#   The TestProperties class can be found in:
#   ojdbc-provider-common/src/testFixtures/java/oracle/jdbc/provider/TestProperties.java
#   The default behavior of TestProperties is to read a file named
#   "test.properties" in the current directory. A non-default location may be
#   specified as a JVM system property:
#   mvn clean verify -Doracle.jdbc.provider.TestProperties=/path/to/my-test.properties
#
# MAINTAINING THIS FILE
#   Project maintainers should add an example to this file anytime they write a
#   test which requires a new property. Not doing so will inflict pain and
#   suffering upon our fellow programmers, and will also lead to increased
#   maintenance costs.
#
# IGNORING UNCONFIGURED PROPERTIES
#   No test should cause a build failure due to an unconfigured property.
#   Using JUnit terminology: A test should "abort" rather than "fail" when a
#   property is not configured. This means that the test does not pass, but it
#   does not cause the build to fail either.
#   Methods of the TestProperties class will automatically abort a test if a
#   property is not configured. The org.junit.jupiter.api.Assumptions class may
#   also be used directly to abort a test.
#   There is NO environment in which ALL tests can be run. Some tests may
#   require authentication as a managed identity in an Azure VM, while other
#   tests require authentication as an instance principal in an OCI compute
#   instance; These environments are mutually exclusive. This is one reason why
#   tests can not fail the build if a required property is not set.
#   A more practical reason is that developers may not need to run all tests if
#   their changes are isolated to single module. For instance, a developer
#   working on an OCI provider should not need to set up an Azure tenancy to test
#   their changes.
