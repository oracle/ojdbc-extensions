# An example of a connection properties file that configures Oracle JDBC to
# obtain a TLS wallet and SEPS credentials from HCP Vault Secrets Service.
#
# This file can be located by Oracle JDBC using the "oracle.jdbc.config.file"
# connection property. For details, see:
# https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/23/jajdb/oracle/jdbc/OracleConnection.html#CONNECTION_PROPERTY_CONFIG_FILE

# Configures the HCP Vault Secrets TCPS (TLS) Wallet Provider. The secret name is
# configured as an environment variable or JVM system property  named "TLS_WALLET_SECRET_NAME".
oracle.jdbc.provider.tlsConfiguration=ojdbc-provider-hcpvault-secrets-tls
oracle.jdbc.provider.tlsConfiguration.secretName=${TLS_WALLET_SECRET_NAME}

# Configures the HCP Vault Secrets TLS Wallet Password. The password for the
# file is optional and can be configured as an environment variable or JVM
# system property named "TLS_FILE_PASSWORD".
oracle.jdbc.provider.tlsConfiguration.walletPassword=${TLS_FILE_PASSWORD}

# Specifies the file type (SSO, PKCS12, or PEM) for the TCPS wallet.
# This can be configured as an environment variable or JVM system property named "TLS_FILE_TYPE".
oracle.jdbc.provider.tlsConfiguration.type=${TLS_FILE_TYPE}

# Configures the HCP Vault Secrets SEPS (Secure External Password Store) Provider.
# Secret Name is configured as environment variables or JVM system properties
# named "SEPS_WALLET_SECRET_NAME".
oracle.jdbc.provider.username=ojdbc-provider-hcpvault-secrets-seps

# Configures the Secret Name for SEPS.

# Optional password for SEPS Wallet stored in HCP Vault Secret.

# Optional connection string index for SEPS Wallet.
# This determines which set of credentials (username/password) to use from the SEPS Wallet.
