# An example of a connection properties file that configures Oracle JDBC to
# obtain a TLS wallet and SEPS credentials from Azure Key Vault.
#
# This file can be located by Oracle JDBC using the "oracle.jdbc.config.file"
# connection property. For details, see:
# https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/23/jajdb/oracle/jdbc/OracleConnection.html#CONNECTION_PROPERTY_CONFIG_FILE

# Configures the Azure Key Vault TLS (TCPS) File Provider. The vault URL and
# secret name are configured as environment variables or JVM system properties named
# "KEY_VAULT_URL" and "TLS_WALLET_SECRET_NAME" respectively:
oracle.jdbc.provider.tlsConfiguration=ojdbc-provider-azure-key-vault-tls
oracle.jdbc.provider.tlsConfiguration.vaultUrl=${KEY_VAULT_URL}
oracle.jdbc.provider.tlsConfiguration.secretName=${TLS_WALLET_SECRET_NAME}

# Configures the Azure Key Vault TLS File Password Provider. The password for the
# file is optional and can be configured as an environment variable or JVM
# system property named "TLS_FILE_PASSWORD":
oracle.jdbc.provider.tlsConfiguration.password=${TLS_FILE_PASSWORD}

# Specifies the file type (SSO, PKCS12, or PEM). This determines how the file is processed.
# This can be configured as an environment variable or JVM system property named "TLS_FILE_TYPE":
oracle.jdbc.provider.tlsConfiguration.type=${TLS_FILE_TYPE}

# Configures the Azure Key Vault SEPS (Secure External Password Store) Provider.
# The vault URL and secret name are configured as environment variables or JVM system properties
# named "KEY_VAULT_URL" and "SEPS_WALLET_SECRET_NAME" respectively:
oracle.jdbc.provider.username=ojdbc-provider-azure-key-vault-seps
oracle.jdbc.provider.password=ojdbc-provider-azure-key-vault-seps

# Configures the vault URL and secret name for SEPS.
oracle.jdbc.provider.username.vaultUrl=${KEY_VAULT_URL}
oracle.jdbc.provider.username.secretName=${SEPS_WALLET_SECRET_NAME}
oracle.jdbc.provider.password.vaultUrl=${KEY_VAULT_URL}
oracle.jdbc.provider.password.secretName=${SEPS_WALLET_SECRET_NAME}

# Optional password for SEPS Wallet stored in Azure Key Vault
oracle.jdbc.provider.username.walletPassword=${SEPS_WALLET_PASSWORD}
oracle.jdbc.provider.password.walletPassword=${SEPS_WALLET_PASSWORD}

# Optional connection string index for SEPS Wallet
# This determines which set of credentials (username/password) to use from the SEPS Wallet
oracle.jdbc.provider.username.connectionStringIndex=${SEPS_CONNECTION_STRING_INDEX}
oracle.jdbc.provider.password.connectionStringIndex=${SEPS_CONNECTION_STRING_INDEX}
