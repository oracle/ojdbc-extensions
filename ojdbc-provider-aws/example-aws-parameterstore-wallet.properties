# An example of a connection properties file that configures Oracle JDBC to
# obtain SEPS credentials from AWS Parameter Store.
#
# This file can be located by Oracle JDBC using the "oracle.jdbc.config.file"
# connection property. For details, see:
# https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/23/jajdb/oracle/jdbc/OracleConnection.html#CONNECTION_PROPERTY_CONFIG_FILE

# Configures the AWS Parameter Store SEPS Wallet Provider for both username and password.
# The SEPS wallet parameter name, wallet password, and index are configured via
# "SEPS_WALLET_PARAMETER_NAME", "SEPS_WALLET_PASSWORD", and "SEPS_CONNECTION_STRING_INDEX".
