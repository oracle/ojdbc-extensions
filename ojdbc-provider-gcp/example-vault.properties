# An example of a connection properties file that configures Oracle JDBC to
# obtain a username and password from OCI's Vault Service.
#
# This file can be located by Oracle JDBC using the "oracle.jdbc.config.file"
# connection property. For details, see:
# https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/23/jajdb/oracle/jdbc/OracleConnection.html#CONNECTION_PROPERTY_CONFIG_FILE

# Configures the GCP Vault Secret Username Provider. The resurce name of the 
# username secret is configured as an environment variable or JVM system 
# property named "USERNAME_SECRET_VERSION_NAME":
oracle.jdbc.provider.username=ojdbc-provider-gcp-secretmanager-username
oracle.jdbc.provider.username.secretVersionName=${USERNAME_SECRET_VERSION_NAME}

# Configures the OCI Vault Secret Password Provider. The resource name of the 
# password secret is configured as an environment variable or JVM system 
# property named "PASSWORD_SECRET_VERSION_NAME":

oracle.jdbc.provider.password.secretVersionName=${PASSWORD_SECRET_VERSION_NAME}

# Configures the GCP Secret Manager Connection String Provider. The secret version name and
# tns alias are configured as environment variables or JVM system properties
# named "GCP_SECRET_VERSION_NAME" and "TNS_ALIAS".
