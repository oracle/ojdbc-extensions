# An example of a connection properties file that configures Oracle JDBC to
# obtain a TLS wallet and SEPS credentials from GCP Secret Manager.
#
# This file can be located by Oracle JDBC using the "oracle.jdbc.config.file"
# connection property. For details, see:
# https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/23/jajdb/oracle/jdbc/OracleConnection.html#CONNECTION_PROPERTY_CONFIG_FILE

# Configures the GCP Secret Manager TLS (TCPS) File Provider. The secret version name is
# configured as an environment variable or JVM system property named "GCP_TLS_WALLET_SECRET_VERSION":
oracle.jdbc.provider.tlsConfiguration=ojdbc-provider-gcp-secretmanager-tls
oracle.jdbc.provider.tlsConfiguration.secretVersionName=${GCP_TLS_WALLET_SECRET_VERSION}

# Configures the GCP Secret Manager TLS File Password Provider. The password for the
# file is optional and can be configured as an environment variable or JVM
# system property named "GCP_TLS_FILE_PASSWORD":
oracle.jdbc.provider.tlsConfiguration.walletPassword=${GCP_TLS_FILE_PASSWORD}

# Specifies the file type (SSO, PKCS12, or PEM). This determines how the file is processed.
# This can be configured as an environment variable or JVM system property named "GCP_TLS_FILE_TYPE":
oracle.jdbc.provider.tlsConfiguration.type=${GCP_TLS_FILE_TYPE}

# Configures the GCP Secret Manager SEPS (Secure External Password Store) Provider.
# The secret version name is configured as an environment variable or JVM system property
# named "GCP_SEPS_WALLET_SECRET_VERSION":
oracle.jdbc.provider.username=ojdbc-provider-gcp-secretmanager-seps
oracle.jdbc.provider.password=ojdbc-provider-gcp-secretmanager-seps

# Configures the secret version name for SEPS.
oracle.jdbc.provider.username.secretVersionName=${GCP_SEPS_WALLET_SECRET_VERSION}
oracle.jdbc.provider.password.secretVersionName=${GCP_SEPS_WALLET_SECRET_VERSION}

# Optional password for SEPS Wallet stored in GCP Secret Manager
oracle.jdbc.provider.username.walletPassword=${GCP_SEPS_WALLET_PASSWORD}
oracle.jdbc.provider.password.walletPassword=${GCP_SEPS_WALLET_PASSWORD}

# Optional connection string index for SEPS Wallet
# This determines which set of credentials (username/password) to use from the SEPS Wallet
oracle.jdbc.provider.username.connectionStringIndex=${GCP_SEPS_CONNECTION_STRING_INDEX}
oracle.jdbc.provider.password.connectionStringIndex=${GCP_SEPS_CONNECTION_STRING_INDEX}
